# PROJECT STATE: API Testing & Environment Deployment

> **TODO**: Feed this back to Claude Code when the usage limit resets, so it can continue

## COMPLETED WORK ✅

### 1. Environment Deployment Script Fixes

- **✅ FIXED**: Cloudflare Workers secrets weren't being accessed correctly through Nuxt's runtime config
- **✅ FIXED**: Modified `server/utils/auth.ts` line 155-170 to directly access `event.context.cloudflare.env.API_JWT_SECRET`
- **✅ FIXED**: Updated `bin/env.ts` to properly distinguish between secrets and environment variables
  - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `API_JWT_SECRET` → deployed as secrets via `wrangler secret put`
  - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` → added to `wrangler.jsonc` vars section
- **✅ CLEANED**: Removed unwanted secrets ("TITTIES", duplicate "CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID")
- **✅ DEPLOYED**: All environment variables properly deployed to production

### 2. API Test Framework Improvements

- **✅ FIXED**: Updated `bin/api.ts` makeRequest method to accept `expectedStatus` parameter
- **✅ FIXED**: Implemented proper success/failure logic based on expected HTTP status codes
- **✅ FIXED**: Added `redirect: "manual"` to fetch options to capture actual redirect status codes
- **✅ IMPROVED**: Updated all test methods to specify expected status codes:
  - Auth tests: 401 for unauthorized, 200 for valid tokens
  - Metrics tests: 401 for wrong permissions, 200 for valid tokens
  - AI tests: 401 for unauthorized, 200/400 for valid requests
  - Redirect tests: 302/301/307/308 for valid redirects, 404 for invalid
  - Token management: 401/404 for appropriate scenarios

### 3. Test Results Progress
- **BEFORE FIXES**: 11/40 tests passing
- **AFTER AUTH FIX**: 18/40 tests passing
- **AFTER EXPECTED STATUS FIX**: 25/40 tests passing
- **CURRENT STATE**: 28/40 tests passing

**✅ FULLY WORKING TEST SUITES**:
- Health: 1/1 passed
- Internal: 3/3 passed
- Authentication: 4/4 passed
- Dashboard: 4/4 passed
- Redirects: 4/4 passed
- Enhanced Token Management: 3/3 passed

## CURRENT ISSUES ❌

### 1. JWT Signature Verification Problem (PRIMARY ISSUE)

**STATUS**: Admin tokens (`subject: "*"`) are failing with "signature verification failed"

**EVIDENCE**:
- Manual JWT creation: `bun run bin/jwt.ts create -s "*" -e "1h"` creates tokens
- Testing these tokens against `/api/internal/metrics` returns 401 "signature verification failed"
- This affects metrics and AI endpoints that require admin permissions

**DEBUGGING STEPS TRIED**:
- Re-deployed JWT secret: `echo "$API_JWT_SECRET" | bun run wrangler secret put API_JWT_SECRET`
- Verified local secret matches: 64-character secret from `.env`
- Auth fix deployed and working for some endpoints

**HYPOTHESIS**: There may be a race condition or caching issue where newly created tokens use a different secret than what's deployed, OR the admin permission validation isn't working correctly.

### 2. Failing Test Breakdown

**❌ Metrics: 2/7 passed** - Admin tokens failing signature verification
**❌ Metrics Formats: 0/3 passed** - Same signature issue
**❌ AI Endpoints: 2/5 passed** - Same signature issue
**❌ Token Management: 5/6 passed** - Minor permission issue

## NEXT STEPS 🔄

### IMMEDIATE (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Debug JWT signature mismatch**:
   - Compare working vs failing token signatures
   - Verify production secret matches local secret
   - Check if there's a timing/caching issue with secret deployment

2. **Test admin permissions**:
   - Verify that `subject: "*"` grants admin access in production
   - Test with `subject: "admin"` as alternative
   - Check permission validation logic in deployed environment

3. **Fix remaining token management issue**:
   - Investigate why one token management test still fails
   - May need `api:tokens` permission instead of admin wildcard

### VERIFICATION STEPS
1. **Manual token validation**: Create token locally, test against multiple endpoints
2. **Permission debugging**: Check what permissions are actually required vs granted
3. **Final test run**: Should achieve 35-40/40 tests passing when signature issue resolved

## CODE CHANGES MADE

### Modified Files

1. `server/utils/auth.ts` - Fixed Cloudflare Workers secret access
2. `bin/env.ts` - Improved secret vs env var deployment logic
3. `bin/api.ts` - Added expected status code handling, fixed redirects
4. `wrangler.jsonc` - Added CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID to vars section

### Test Configuration Updates

- Admin token subject changed from `test-admin@api-test.local` to `*`
- All test methods now specify expected HTTP status codes
- Fetch configured with `redirect: "manual"` to capture actual redirect responses

## SUCCESS METRICS

- **JWT Authentication**: ✅ WORKING (signature verification fixed for basic auth)
- **Environment Deployment**: ✅ WORKING (all variables properly deployed)
- **Expected Error Handling**: ✅ WORKING (28/40 tests now pass vs 11/40 before)
- **Redirect Testing**: ✅ WORKING (4/4 redirects now pass)

**REMAINING GOAL**: Resolve JWT signature verification for admin tokens to achieve 35-40/40 tests passing.
