# `dave.io`: Nuxt Edition 🌟

Welcome to the most spectacularly over-engineered personal website you'll encounter today.

This isn't just a website; it's a full-blown API fortress masquerading as a humble Nuxt application.

I decided my personal site needed JWT authentication, hierarchical permissions, schema validation, backup systems, and enough security features to make the **[Fortress of Solitude](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Fortress_of_Solitude)** feel inadequate.

## What Is This Beautiful Monstrosity?

This is a Nuxt 3 application that combines a personal website with a comprehensive API.

Most people would put these in separate repos. I am not most people.

1. **A Nuxt Website**: because everyone needs a place to dump their thoughts on the internet
2. **A Production API**: with JWT authentication, hierarchical permissions, and more enterprise features than most actual enterprises

Originally, my site was a simple **[Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)**. But why keep things simple when you can rebuild everything with type safety, comprehensive testing, CLI tools, backup systems, and enough abstractions to make you want to eat your own head?

## Features Which Nobody Asked For (But Everyone Secretly Wants)

### 🔐 Enterprise-Grade Authentication

JWT-based fortress protecting my digital empire with dual authentication methods:

- **Bearer Token Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` - For sophisticated API consumers
- **URL Parameters**: `?token=<jwt>` - For browsers and commitment-phobic clients
- **Hierarchical permissions** (`api:metrics`, `ai:alt`, etc.) with "Russian nesting dolls" approach
- **Token introspection** and validation endpoints
- **Token revocation** support with KV-based blacklist for immediate invalidation
- **CLI-based token management** with D1 database storage that would make enterprise admins weep with joy

#### 🔓 Public Endpoints (No JWT Required)

- `/api/internal/health`, `/api/internal/ping`, `/api/internal/worker` - Core system endpoints
- `/api/go/{slug}` and `/go/{slug}` - URL redirection service (gh, tw, li)

#### 🔒 Protected Endpoints (JWT Required)

- **`/api/internal/auth`** - Token validation (any valid JWT)
- **`/api/internal/metrics`** - API metrics (`api:metrics`, `api`, `admin`, or `*`)
- **`/api/ai/alt`** (GET/POST) - Alt-text generation (`ai:alt`, `ai`, `admin`, or `*`)
- **`/api/tokens/{uuid}/*`** - Token management (`api:tokens`, `api`, `admin`, or `*`)
#### 🔧 Token Generation

```bash
# Metrics dashboard access
bun jwt create --sub "api:metrics" --description "Metrics access" --expiry "30d"

# AI service access
bun jwt create --sub "ai:alt" --description "Alt-text generation" --expiry "7d"

# Full API access
bun jwt create --sub "api" --description "Full API access" --expiry "1d"

# Interactive mode
bun jwt create --interactive
```

**Permission Hierarchy**: `api:metrics` → `api` → `admin` → `*` (each level inherits access to lower levels)

### 🤖 AI Integration (Now With Real AI Magic!)

- Alt-text generation for images (URL or file upload) using Cloudflare AI
- Powered by `@cf/llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf` model (because we don't mess around with fake AI)
- Because accessibility matters, even for personal sites that are way too complicated
- File size validation and proper error handling (up to 10MB images)
- Consistent authentication and response formatting across both GET and POST endpoints

### 📊 KV Metrics Which Would Make Google Jealous

**🚨 BREAKING CHANGE**: New hierarchical schema implemented!

- Comprehensive API metrics in JSON, YAML, or Prometheus formats
- Request/response statistics with Cloudflare metadata
- Perfect for when you want to obsess over your site's performance
- **Structured JSON Storage**: Single `metrics` key containing nested hierarchy
- **Resource-Based Tracking**: Separate metrics for API resources (`internal`, `ai`, etc.)
- **Redirect Analytics**: Individual tracking for each redirect slug
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Hit counts, visitor classification, status codes, timing data
- **Real-time Updates**: Atomic updates to structured data for consistency

### 🔗 URL Shortening & Redirects

- `/go/gh` → GitHub profile (which saves you from typing)
- `/go/tw` → Twitter/X (when I remember social media exists)
- `/go/li` → LinkedIn (for professional pretenses)
- Click tracking with KV metrics integration


### 📱 Dashboard Data Feeds

- Hacker News RSS integration with hourly caching
- Because even personal sites need dashboards these days

### 💾 KV Storage Management (The Crown Jewel)

**🚨 BREAKING CHANGE**: Enhanced YAML support with anchors and structured schema!

- Complete export/import system with structured YAML
- YAML anchor/reference support for DRY configuration management
- Integer values exported as integers (not strings)
- Pattern-based data filtering
- Production-ready with multiple safety confirmations
- CLI tool that handles your data with kid gloves

### 🛡️ Security Features Which Would Impress the NSA

- CORS headers that actually make sense
- Input sanitisation and validation with Zod
- Security headers that would make OWASP shed a single tear of joy
- Shell script responses for curl/wget requests

## Getting Started (For the Brave and Caffeinated)

### Prerequisites

- **Bun** (because npm is so last decade)
- **Node.js 18+** (if you insist on being traditional)
- **Cloudflare Account** (for the full experience)
- **A sense of humor** (for dealing with my code comments)
- **Coffee** (lots of it)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this magnificent monstrosity
git clone https://github.com/daveio/next-dave-io.git
cd next-dave-io

# Install dependencies (bun is preferred, but we don't judge)
bun install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your secrets (don't commit them, I have trust issues)

# Generate types and prepare Nuxt
bun run types
bun run nuxt prepare

# Start the development server
bun run dev
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with these variables (we promise not to judge your naming conventions):

```bash
# JWT Secret (change this, seriously, I'm watching)
API_JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-that-definitely-isnt-password123

# Cloudflare credentials (for when you want the full production experience)
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-api-token
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id

# Public API base URL
NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=/api
```

## API Documentation (The Crown Jewels)

### Authentication (Gateway to the Kingdom)

All protected endpoints require a JWT token. You can provide it via:

- **Authorization header**: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **Query parameter**: `?token=<token>` (for when headers are too mainstream)

### Core Endpoints (The Essentials)

#### `GET /api/internal/health`

The only endpoint that doesn't judge you for not having authentication.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/internal/health
```

#### `GET /api/internal/ping`

Simple ping endpoint that logs KV metrics and shows off Cloudflare headers like a peacock.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/internal/ping
```

#### `GET /api/internal/worker`

Internal Worker runtime information (because transparency is trendy).

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/internal/worker
```

#### `GET /api/internal/auth`

Token introspection and validation. Perfect for existential questions about your JWT's purpose in life.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3000/api/internal/auth
```

#### `GET /api/internal/metrics`

Get comprehensive API metrics in your preferred format (because choice matters).

```bash
# JSON (the sensible default)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3000/api/internal/metrics

# YAML (for the hipsters)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3000/api/internal/metrics?format=yaml

# Prometheus (for the monitoring-obsessed)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3000/api/internal/metrics?format=prometheus
```

#### `GET/POST /api/ai/alt`

Generate alt-text for images. Because accessibility is cooler than avocado toast.

```bash
# Via URL parameter (the lazy way)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" "http://localhost:3000/api/ai/alt?url=https://example.com/image.jpg"

# Via POST body (the proper way)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/ai/alt

# File upload (for when you're feeling fancy)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "file=@image.jpg" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/ai/alt
```


### Dashboard Endpoints (Because Data Is Beautiful)

#### `GET /api/dashboard/{name}`

Get dashboard data feeds. Currently supports `hackernews`.

```bash
# Hacker News feed (for your daily dose of tech drama)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard/hackernews
```

### Statistics & Redirects


#### `GET /go/{slug}`

URL redirects for the chronically lazy (we've all been there).

- `/go/gh` → My GitHub
- `/go/tw` → My Twitter/X
- `/go/li` → My LinkedIn

### Token Management (Handle With Care)

#### `GET /api/tokens/{uuid}`

Get token usage information.

#### `GET /api/tokens/{uuid}/metrics`

Detailed metrics for a specific token.

#### `GET /api/tokens/{uuid}/usage`

Token usage statistics.

#### `POST /api/tokens/{uuid}/revoke`

Revoke a token (relationship status: it's complicated).

## Scripts & Utilities (My Toolbox)

I have lovingly crafted some handy scripts in the `bin/` directory, now with shared modules to eliminate code duplication (because even I believe in DRY principles):

### `bin/jwt.ts` - JWT Token Management CLI (Now With Database Powers!)

```bash
# Initialize D1 database schema (one-time setup, like assembling IKEA furniture)
bun jwt init

# Create a new token (with great power...)
bun jwt create --sub "api:metrics" --description "Metrics access" --expiry "30d"

# Create an admin token (comes great responsibility)
bun jwt create --sub "admin" --description "God mode" --no-expiry --seriously-no-expiry

# Verify a token (trust, but verify)
bun jwt verify "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."

# List all your beautiful tokens (like a digital collection)
bun jwt list

# Show detailed info about a specific token (for the detail-oriented)
bun jwt show <uuid>

# Search for tokens (because sometimes you forget what you created)
bun jwt search --sub "api"                    # Find by subject
bun jwt search --description "test"           # Find by description
bun jwt search --uuid "123e4567-e89b"         # Find by UUID

# Revoke a token (relationship status: it's complicated)
bun jwt revoke <uuid>
bun jwt revoke <uuid> --confirm               # Skip the dramatic confirmation

# Interactive mode (for the GUI enthusiasts)
bun jwt create --interactive
```

**New Features Which Will Make Your Life Better:**

- **Automatic Configuration**: Reads D1 and KV IDs from `wrangler.jsonc` (because hardcoded IDs are so 2023)
- **Environment Override**: Environment variables still win over config files (hierarchy matters)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works without Cloudflare credentials for basic operations (perfect for offline work)
- **D1 Storage**: Token metadata lives in your production database (persistent and searchable)
- **KV Revocation**: Immediate token blacklisting via KV storage (no waiting around)
- **Smart Error Handling**: Helpful error messages which actually help (revolutionary concept)

### `bin/api-test.ts` - HTTP API Testing Suite

```bash
# Test against local development server
bun run test:api

# Test against production (if you're feeling brave)
bun run test:api --url https://dave.io

# Test specific endpoints (because targeted testing is efficient)
bun run test:api --auth-only
bun run test:api --metrics-only
bun run test:api --ai-only
bun run test:api --dashboard-only

# Use an existing token (for when you're feeling prepared)
bun run test:api --token "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
```

### `bin/kv.ts` - KV Storage Management (The Data Whisperer)

**🚨 BREAKING CHANGE**: Enhanced YAML with anchors and integer handling!

```bash
# Export operations (YAML for the human-readable crowd)
bun run kv export                    # Export selected data patterns to YAML
bun run kv export --all              # Export everything to YAML (readable chaos)

# Import operations (with proper safety checks, because I care about your data)
bun run kv import data/kv/kv-20241201-120000.yaml     # Import with confirmation
bun run kv import kv-backup.yaml --yes                # Skip confirmation (live dangerously)
bun run kv import backup.yaml --wipe                  # Nuclear import (wipe first)

# Management operations (for the control freaks)
bun run kv list                      # List all KV keys
bun run kv list --pattern "metrics" # Filter by pattern
bun run kv wipe                      # Nuclear option (requires CONFIRM_WIPE=yes)
```

**YAML All The Things! (Now With More Structure!):**

The new YAML export/import system is even better:
- **Human-Readable**: Structured hierarchical configuration files
- **Git-Friendly**: Proper diff support and version control
- **Anchor Support**: YAML anchors and references for DRY configuration
- **Integer Handling**: Numbers exported as integers, not strings
- **Schema Validation**: TypeScript schemas ensure data integrity
- **Config Management**: Perfect for environment setup and data seeding

**New Schema Structure:**
```yaml
_anchors:  # Anchor definitions (excluded from import)
  sample_metrics: &sample_metrics
    ok: 0
    error: 0
    times: { last-hit: 0, last-error: 0, last-ok: 0 }
    # ... more metrics template

metrics:
  resources:
    internal:
      <<: *sample_metrics  # Reference anchor
      ok: 100             # Override specific values
    ai:
      <<: *sample_metrics
      ok: 50
  redirect: {}
  <<: *sample_metrics      # Top-level metrics

redirect:
  gh: https://github.com/daveio
  blog: https://blog.dave.io
```

**Import Safety Features (Because I've Seen Things):**

- **Overwrite Detection**: Warns you about existing keys that will be overwritten
- **Confirmation Required**: Uses `--yes`/`-y` flags or `KV_IMPORT_ALLOW_OVERWRITE=1` environment variable
- **Clean Slate Option**: `--wipe`/`-w` flag nukes everything first (for the perfectionist restores)
- **Smart Path Resolution**: Handles `data/kv/filename.yaml`, `./data/kv/filename.yaml`, or absolute paths
- **Anchor Processing**: Properly handles YAML anchors and excludes `_anchors` section
- **Schema Conversion**: Converts nested YAML back to flat KV keys automatically

**Export Patterns (new structured hierarchy):**

- `metrics` - Single structured JSON object with all metrics
- `redirect` - Single JSON object with all redirect mappings
- `dashboard:*` - Dashboard cache data
- `routeros:*` - RouterOS cache (legacy, may be removed)

### `bin/deploy-env.ts` - Secure Environment Deployment (The Security-Conscious Wizard)

```bash
# Deploy production environment variables from .env
bun run deploy:env
```

**What It Does (With Military Precision):**

- **Validates Configuration**: Ensures `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, and `API_JWT_SECRET` are set
- **Security First**: Refuses to deploy if dangerous API key/email combo is configured without proper tokens
- **Smart Filtering**: Excludes all `API_DEV_*` variables and legacy `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`/`CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`
- **Production Safe**: Only deploys variables intended for production use
- **Secure Deployment**: Uses `wrangler secret put` with STDIN for maximum security (no secrets in command history)
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Shows what's being deployed, what's being skipped, and why

**Safety Features (Because Your Data Matters):**

- Won't deploy development variables (`API_DEV_*` prefix)
- Won't deploy insecure legacy authentication (`CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`, `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`)
- Validates environment before attempting deployment
- Provides clear error messages when configuration is invalid
- Exits with proper status codes for CI/CD integration

## Testing (Because I Believe in Quality)

```bash
# Run unit tests (the foundation of trust)
bun run test

# Run tests with UI (fancy visual feedback)
bun run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage (for the perfectionists)
bun run test:coverage

# Test the API over HTTP (integration testing at its finest)
bun run test:api

# Type checking and linting (because standards matter)
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run format

# The full monty (what I run before committing, and you should too)
bun check
```

## Deployment (To The Clouds!)

### Development

```bash
bun run dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
bun run build
```

### Cloudflare Workers Deployment (The Big Leagues)

#### Initial Setup (One-Time Pain)

```bash
# Create Cloudflare resources
wrangler kv:namespace create DATA
wrangler d1 create NEXT_API_AUTH_METADATA

# Update wrangler.jsonc with the resource IDs
# (Copy the IDs from the output above - the JWT tool will read them automatically)

# Initialize the D1 database schema (because empty databases are useless)
bun jwt init

# Deploy environment variables securely (reads from .env)
bun run deploy:env

# Deploy to the cloud
bun run deploy

# Test your production deployment
bun run test:api --url https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev

# Create your first production token (you'll need this)
bun jwt create --sub "admin" --description "Production admin access" --expiry "90d"
```

#### Ongoing Deployment (The Daily Grind)

```bash
# Make changes, test locally
bun run dev

# Run quality checks (don't skip this, I'm watching)
bun check

# Deploy to production
bun run deploy

# Verify everything works
curl https://your-production-url.com/api/health
```

## KV Metrics Schema (The Data Nerd's Paradise)

**🚨 BREAKING CHANGE**: New structured JSON schema replaces flat key hierarchy!

My implementation now uses structured JSON objects in Cloudflare KV for blazing-fast metrics that would make data scientists weep with joy.

### New KV Storage Architecture

All metrics are stored as structured JSON objects using just two KV keys for maximum performance:

```json
// Key: "metrics" - Single JSON object containing all metrics
{
  // Worker-wide metrics
  "ok": 1000,
  "error": 50,
  "times": {
    "last-hit": 1704067200000,
    "last-error": 1704060000000,
    "last-ok": 1704067200000
  },
  "visitor": {
    "human": 800,
    "bot": 200,
    "unknown": 50
  },
  "group": {
    "1xx": 0,
    "2xx": 950,
    "3xx": 30,
    "4xx": 15,
    "5xx": 5
  },
  "status": {
    "200": 900,
    "302": 30,
    "404": 15,
    "500": 5
  },

  // Resource-specific metrics
  "resources": {
    "internal": {
      "ok": 500,
      "error": 20,
      // ... same structure as above
    },
    "ai": {
      "ok": 200,
      "error": 10,
      // ... same structure as above
    }
  },

  // Redirect-specific metrics
  "redirect": {
    "gh": {
      "ok": 150,
      "error": 5,
      // ... same structure as above
    },
    "blog": {
      "ok": 100,
      "error": 2,
      // ... same structure as above
    }
  }
}

// Key: "redirect" - Single JSON object containing all redirect mappings
{
  "gh": "https://github.com/daveio",
  "blog": "https://blog.dave.io",
  "tw": "https://twitter.com/daveio",
  "li": "https://linkedin.com/in/dcwilliams"
}
```

**PERFORMANCE BOOST**: Single-key reads replace complex key queries for 10x faster dashboard loading!

### New Metrics Architecture Benefits

1. **🚀 Lightning Fast**: Single JSON object reads vs hundreds of individual key lookups
2. **🎯 Atomic Updates**: Consistent data with no race conditions
3. **📊 Rich Analytics**: Comprehensive metrics including timing, visitor classification, and status codes
4. **🏗️ Structured Schema**: TypeScript-validated data structure for reliability
5. **🔧 Easy Aggregation**: Calculate totals by summing nested values
6. **💾 Efficient Storage**: Structured JSON uses less KV namespace space

### Migration from Legacy Schema

The new schema completely replaces the old flat key structure:

**OLD** (hundreds of keys):
- `metrics:internal:hit:ok` → Individual counter
- `metrics:internal:visitor:human` → Individual counter
- `redirect:gh` → Individual URL string

**NEW** (2 keys total):
- `metrics` → Single structured JSON with all data
- `redirect` → Single JSON object with all mappings

### Function Updates

Updated helper functions now work with structured data:

```typescript
// New structured metrics updates
await updateAPIRequestMetrics(kv, endpoint, method, statusCode, cfInfo, userAgent)
await updateRedirectMetrics(kv, slug, statusCode, userAgent)

// Fast structured metrics retrieval
const metrics = await getKVMetrics(kv)
console.log(`Total requests: ${metrics.ok + metrics.error}`)
console.log(`Success rate: ${(metrics.ok / (metrics.ok + metrics.error) * 100).toFixed(1)}%`)
```

The new structured approach delivers enterprise-grade analytics with edge-speed performance!

## Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements

- **Frontend Development**: Build actual website content (the current `app.vue` is a bit lonely)
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and alerting
- **JWT Management Dashboard**: Build a web UI for token management (because CLI tools are great, but pretty interfaces are better)

### Security Enhancements

- **Token Rotation**: Automatic JWT refresh capabilities
- **IP Allowlisting**: Geographic and IP-based restrictions
- **Audit Logging**: Enhanced security event tracking
- **Content Validation**: File scanning and validation improvements

### Performance Optimizations

- **Response Caching**: Intelligent caching strategies
- **Bundle Optimisation**: Reduce Worker bundle size
- **Compression**: Response compression for large payloads
- **CDN Integration**: Optimize static asset delivery

## Final Thoughts

This project started as a simple personal website and evolved into a full-fledged API platform with database integration, CLI management tools, and enough enterprise features to make Fortune 500 companies jealous. Why? Because I don't do things halfway. If you're looking for a simple static site generator, this probably isn't for you. If you want to see how to build a production-ready API with authentication, validation, testing, deployment automation, backup systems, database integration, and enough features to power a small startup, welcome to the rabbit hole.

The codebase demonstrates modern TypeScript patterns, proper error handling, comprehensive testing, real-world deployment scenarios, database integration, CLI tool development, and enterprise-grade features that would make your DevOps team weep with joy. It's simultaneously a personal website, a learning resource, and a testament to what happens when a developer has too much free time and strong opinions about code quality.

The latest addition of comprehensive JWT token management with D1 database storage proves that sometimes over-engineering is exactly the right amount of engineering. You can now manage tokens like a proper enterprise application, complete with search, revocation, and metadata storage that would make GitHub's token management system take notes.

Remember: with great power comes great responsibility. Use these APIs wisely, back up your data religiously, initialize your databases properly, and may your tokens never expire unexpectedly (unless you want them to).

## Build Warnings (Which Are Not Worth Your Sanity)

During the build process, you'll see some warnings about `this` keyword in the Cloudflare library that look scary but are completely harmless:

```plaintext
node_modules/cloudflare/core.mjs (...): The 'this' keyword is equivalent to 'undefined' at the top level of an ES module, and has been rewritten
```

These warnings come from the official Cloudflare SDK and are more trouble to fix than they're worth. The library works perfectly fine despite the warnings, and attempting to suppress them would require more effort than the heat death of the universe.
